    <h2 >Summary of Activity 1</h2> 
    <p >An IoT (Internet of Things) application is a software solution that enables communication and interaction between connected devices over a network. These applications are designed to collect, process, and analyze data from IoT devices and present it in a meaningful way to users. Some examples of IoT applications include smart home systems, wearable devices, industrial automation systems, and smart city infrastructure.

  <!-- Summary of Activity 2 -->
    <div class = "p2">
    <h2 >Summary of Activity 2</h2>
    <p >A smart building is a building that utilizes IoT technology and automation to optimize energy efficiency, improve comfort, and increase safety. A smart building typically requires the following components:
      •	IoT Sensors: To collect data on temperature, occupancy, lighting, and other environmental factors.
      •	Network infrastructure: To connect all devices and sensors to a central system.<br>
      •	Building Management System (BMS): To control and automate various building systems, such as heating, cooling, lighting, and security.
      •	User Interfaces: To provide occupants with a way to interact with the building's systems and access information on energy use and other metrics.

  <!-- Summary of Activity 3 -->
    <div class = "p3">
    <h2 >Summary of Activity 3</h2>
    <p >An IoT control interface is the interface through which users can interact with and control IoT devices. It typically includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to monitor and control devices, as well as an application programming interface (API) that enables developers to create custom integrations and automations. An IoT control interface should be user-friendly, secure, and accessible from multiple devices and platforms, such as smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

        <div id="d1">
        <li><b>Agriculture Monitoring and Control</b></li>
        <p id="p5">Agricultural monitoring and control is the use of technology to monitor and control various aspects of agriculture such as soil moisture, temperature, crop growth, and other factors. The goal is to improve crop yields, reduce waste, and optimize resource use in agriculture. Agricultural monitoring and control systems often use sensors, wireless communication, and software to collect and analyze data in real-time, providing insights and information about the health and growth of crops. The collected data can be used to automatically control various aspects of the agricultural environment, such as irrigation and nutrient delivery, to improve crop growth and health. These systems also allow farmers to remotely monitor and control their crops, reducing the need for manual labor and increasing efficiency.</p>
